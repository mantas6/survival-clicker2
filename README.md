## Releases

The latest stable release is [available here](https://mantas6.github.io/survival-clicker2)

## Intro

The original *Survival Clicker* was inspired by the survival/crafting video game genre. Although crafting mechanics never made sense to be in the game (obvious reasons). Rather it was meant to highlight the struggle of survival, the feeling that player gets when he just barely makes thought the harsh stages, the immersive experience the player has while simultaneously growing in with the in-game character.

*Survival Clicker* was developed spontaneously during a very short period of time, a few stability updates were released and not much development was seen past that, making it stuck in a prototype stage forever. The implementation simply did not allow any further expansion without a rewrite.

Certain things have come in to an alignment making now -- the perfect time to revisit this concept and possibly make it into a more fully fledged experience. This is where the *Survival Clicker 2* starts. Explore [the design document](docs/Design-Document/Design-Document-e000f04c-b05b-4dfc-83b0-3770f478d276.md) to get your whereabouts.

## Development progress

The base functionality is currently being implemented for the game. Once it's done, game will be tagged as `0.1` alpha. Then further implementations can begin. *See:* [Modules](docs/Design-Document/Modules-c911879c-ec8c-4106-86d0-a8b9468d5bb8.md).
